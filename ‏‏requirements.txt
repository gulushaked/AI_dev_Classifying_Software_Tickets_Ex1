# Description:
# This assignment uses OpenAI models via Azure to:
#   1. Determine whether software tickets contain single or multiple issues.
#   2. Categorize single-issue tickets into 8 predefined types.
#   3. Evaluate model accuracy using ground truth and generate detailed statistics.
# Required Files:
#   - hw1.py                    # Main script (entry point)
#   - gt.py                     # Ground truth checker (used in Part 3)
#   - environment_variables     # file with required Azure credentials
#   - tkts_1.txt                # Input for Part 1
#   - tkts_2.txt                # Input for Part 2 
#
# Setup Notes:
# - Please note that the hw1.py script is expecting both input files and environment variables file to be located inside the
#    same directory as it is located at.
# - Input files names are hardcoded in the hw1.py script
# - Thanks for your time evaluating our work :)
#
# Output Files Generated:
#   - split.txt       # LLM predictions for split/no-split classification (Part 1)
#   - categories.txt  # LLM predictions for category classification (Part 2)
#   - statistics.txt  # Evaluation statistics summary (Part 3)
